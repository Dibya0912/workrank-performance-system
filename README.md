## ✅ Day 17 — Real User-Based Task Flow & Session Persistence

### 🔥 What was implemented today

Day 17 focused on converting the system from **role-only logic** to a
**real user-id–based architecture**, making the project closer to a
production-ready system.

---

### 👤 User Identity Upgrade
- Tasks are now assigned using **user IDs** instead of role strings
- Every user sees **only their own tasks**
- Performance, score, and rank are calculated per user

---

### 🧠 Task Engine Improvements
- Centralized task filtering using `assignedTo: userId`
- Accurate task completion counts per user
- Score calculation based on completed tasks
- Admin can assign tasks to a specific user ID

---

### 🏆 Leaderboard (Real Logic)
- Leaderboard is dynamically generated
- Sorted by score (descending)
- Rank assigned after sorting
- Logged-in user highlighted in leaderboard

---

### 🔐 Authentication Persistence
- Login state stored in `localStorage`
- Session restored automatically on page reload
- Auto-redirect based on saved role (User/Admin)
- Secure logout clears session properly



## Day 19 – Activity Logs & Auth Session Fix

### What was implemented
- Added centralized **Activity Logs system** for admin
- Logged all critical actions:
  - Task creation
  - Task status updates
  - Task deletion
- Created **Admin Activity Logs page** to view real-time system actions
- Fixed critical **authentication session bug** causing infinite
  "Checking session..." screen after logout
- Introduced proper auth state handling using:
  - `user`
  - `loading` flag

### Technical Highlights
- In-memory activity log store with timestamped entries
- Admin-only protected route for activity logs
- Correct separation between:
  - Session loading
  - Logged-out state
- Improved app behavior to match real-world authentication flow

### Result
- No infinite loading screens
- Clean logout & redirect flow
- Admin has full visibility of system activity
- Application behavior now production-grade instead of demo-level

- ## ✅ Day 21 – Activity Logs Upgrade

### ✔ What was done
- Activity logs saved in **localStorage**
- Central `logActivity()` added in API
- **Admin Activity Logs page** implemented
- Reusable **ActivityFilter** component added
- Logs persist after refresh

### 📂 Files touched
- `api.js`
- `AdminActivity.jsx`
- `ActivityFilter.jsx`
- `Sidebar.jsx`
- `App.jsx`

### 🚀 Result
- Admin can track all system actions
- Logs are filtered, persistent, and clean

✔ Day 21 completed
